# Quick Morph
Make you able to Morph you into anything easily
## Feature
Morph yourself in other entities
## WIP (Work In Progress)
* Custom player control
* A way to see other player who are morphed

## Manual
### How to morph into a mob
Do a left click on an entity while crouching to morph into it.
If the server admins have activated the feature for you, you can execute ``/morph <entity> [player]``
(player is only if the server admins also activated the feature to do so)
### How to edit the plugin configuration
If you are an operator or have the permission `quickmorph.command.config.use` you can execute the command
`/config` with the arguments:
* edit-group \<group> \<parameter> \<value> (edit a group)
* add-group \<group> (create a new group)
* remove-group \<group> (remove a group)
* show-group \<group> (see all a group configuration)
### Player morphing
The player morphing is still in WIP (Work In Progress) but here's how it will work:

* Player creation: create a new player that you can control
* Player control: select a player that you want to control and with his accept you will be able to use the player
